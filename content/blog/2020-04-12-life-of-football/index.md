Live life like a game of Football

I always live my life 90 minutes at a time with two halves, no stoppage time, no extra time and no replays. Just 90 minutes.

Never play for draw in your life

Life can be like a stunner scored from 40 yards out, when the world thinks you cannot do it. Or it can hit you in the head like missing a tap in from 6 yards out. 

Live it with skills, talents and composure.

Some days when you are feeling down, think like its just half time going back into the dressing room, with one goal down. You can either come back out and face your fears and give it one hell of a second half or sit back, sulk and give in.

The choice is yours.

Always remember the game is not done until it is over and so is life.
Live it like grabbing a win in the 90th minute.
A win is a win...

Play beautiful.
Live beautiful.

Life, bloody hell!!!
