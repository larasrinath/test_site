The greatest football team in England, got off to a worse start in 30 years. United occupied 14<sup>th</sup> position after losing 3, drawing 4 and winning just 2 games out of the first 9 games of the season. The team was written off before end of first half of the season. 

What came after was quite astonishing in post SAF era, United beat Mourinhoâ€™s Spurs and Pep's City in a matter of 3 days. But delivering inconsistent performances by the team was regular.

Once in a while a new signing brings joy and passion which cuts through the whole team such was Bruno Fernandes, bought at very end of the winter transfer market, saved the team from an embarrassing finish to the season.

Bruno instantly connected with the forwards like Rashford and Martial. He scored 8 goals and assisted 7. United put on a string of great performances before and after the CoVID19 lockdown. The lockdown helped the injured players to recover and come back and give their best to the team.

The top 4 which once looked bleak at best, due to the team's resurgence saw United finish 3<sup>rd</sup> place. With Champions League spot secured for next year, and still in the hunt for Europe League. There is a very good chance the team will end the season with a silverware.

Many doubted Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, including me, but the charisma of the legend has changed the football club as a whole after years of sleepy, boring football and negativity around the club and team.

This might not be the best team yet, but there is much more to come in the future with OGS and the tricky reds.
